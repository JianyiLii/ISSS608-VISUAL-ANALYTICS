    "text": "1. Overview\n\n1.1 Setting the Scene\nA local online media company that publishes daily content on digital platforms is planning to release an article on demographic structures and distribution of Singapore in 2024. Singapore’s population landscape is constantly evolving due to demographic shifts such as aging, fertility trends, and migration. Understanding the distribution of residents by age, gender, and location is crucial for informed urban planning, resource allocation, and policy formulation. This exercise aims to visualise the 2024 demographic structure and spatial distribution of Singapore residents across planning areas and subzones. Through visual analytics, we seek to uncover meaningful patterns and insights that support public awareness and strategic decision-making.\n\n\n1.2 Task and Objective\nAssuming the role of the graphical editor of the media company, our tasked to prepare at most three data visualisation for the article. The objective of this analysis is to uncover regional population patterns and age composition trends across planning areas in 2024 using visual analytics. Specifically, we aim to:\n\nIdentify age concentrations across planning areas via a heatmap.\nExplore regional disparities in age distribution using boxplots.\nExamine population ageing and youth dependency dynamics through bubble charts.\n\nThese insights will help policymakers and urban planners to design age-targeted strategies that align with the demographic characteristics of each region.\n\n\n1.3 Data Description\nThe dataset used in this study is sourced from the Singapore Department of Statistics and titled “Singapore Residents by Planning Area/Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2024.” It contains information on resident population counts broken down by:\n\nPA —&gt; Planning Area\nSZ —&gt; Subzone\nPop —&gt; Population\nAge\nSex ––&gt; Male or Female\nTime ––&gt; Year of data (2024)\n\n\n\n2. Getting Started\n\n\n2.1 Data Loading\nWe begin by loading the necessary libraries using the pacman package to ensure all required functions are available.\n\ntidyverse: Data manipulation and visualization\npatchwork: Combining multiple plots if needed\nhrbrthemes: Clean and minimal visual themes\nggrepel: Prevent overlapping text labels\nHmisc: Weighted quantile calculations (for boxplot annotations)\n\n\n\nClick to view code\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, patchwork, hrbrthemes, ggrepel, Hmisc)\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Data Import\nNext, we import the main dataset using read_csv(). Since the analysis focuses on the year 2024, we filter accordingly.\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/data.csv\")\n\n\n\n2.3 Data Cleaning\nThe cleaning process involves:\n\nFiltering records to only include Time == 2024.\nHandle Missing value\nGlimpse of data\n\nConverting the Age field:\n\nAny age label containing “100” (e.g., “100+”) is converted to numeric 100.\nAge labels containing “90” (e.g., “90+” or “90_and_over”) are converted to numeric 90.\nAll other age values are converted to numeric as-is.\n\nRemoving rows where the age conversion fails.\n\n\nClick to view code\nclean_data &lt;- exam_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Time == 2024) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Age_num = case_when(\n      str_detect(Age, \"100\") ~ 100,\n      str_detect(Age, \"90\") ~ 90,\n      str_detect(Age, \"^\\\\d+$\") ~ as.numeric(Age),\n      TRUE ~ NA_real_\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Age_num))\n\n\nAdditionally, we standardize age group classification (Youth: ≤19; Working: 20–64; Elderly: ≥65) for later segmentation.\n\nCheck duplicates\n\n\nexam_data %&gt;%\n  duplicated() %&gt;%\n  sum()  # returns number of duplicate rows\n\n[1] 0\n\nexam_data &lt;- exam_data %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\n\nCheck Missing value\n\n\nsummary(exam_data)\n\n      PA                 SZ                Age                Sex           \n Length:60424       Length:60424       Length:60424       Length:60424      \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n      Pop              Time     \n Min.   :   0.0   Min.   :2024  \n 1st Qu.:   0.0   1st Qu.:2024  \n Median :  20.0   Median :2024  \n Mean   :  69.4   Mean   :2024  \n 3rd Qu.:  90.0   3rd Qu.:2024  \n Max.   :1180.0   Max.   :2024  \n\ncolSums(is.na(exam_data))\n\n  PA   SZ  Age  Sex  Pop Time \n   0    0    0    0    0    0 \n\n\n\n\n\nGlimpse of data\n\nstr(exam_data)\n\ntibble [60,424 × 6] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ PA  : chr [1:60424] \"Ang Mo Kio\" \"Ang Mo Kio\" \"Ang Mo Kio\" \"Ang Mo Kio\" ...\n $ SZ  : chr [1:60424] \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\" \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\" \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\" \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\" ...\n $ Age : chr [1:60424] \"0\" \"0\" \"1\" \"1\" ...\n $ Sex : chr [1:60424] \"Males\" \"Females\" \"Males\" \"Females\" ...\n $ Pop : num [1:60424] 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 30 10 ...\n $ Time: num [1:60424] 2024 2024 2024 2024 2024 ...\n\nglimpse(exam_data)\n\nRows: 60,424\nColumns: 6\n$ PA   &lt;chr&gt; \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo K…\n$ SZ   &lt;chr&gt; \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\", \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\", \"Ang Mo Kio T…\n$ Age  &lt;chr&gt; \"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"2\", \"2\", \"3\", \"3\", \"4\", \"4\", \"5\", \"5\", \"6\", …\n$ Sex  &lt;chr&gt; \"Males\", \"Females\", \"Males\", \"Females\", \"Males\", \"Females\", \"Male…\n$ Pop  &lt;dbl&gt; 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 30, 10, 20, 10, 20, 30, 30, 10, 3…\n$ Time &lt;dbl&gt; 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024,…\n\n\n\n3. Exploratory Visual Analysis\n\n\nEDA 1: Heatmap of Population by Age and Planning Area (2024)\nThis heatmap visualizes the total population across different planning areas in Singapore by age. Each row represents a single age (e.g., 0 to 100), and each column corresponds to a planning area. The intensity of color indicates the number of residents in a specific age group within each planning area. Darker shades represent higher population counts, allowing for easy visual comparison of population structure across locations.\nThe data was pre-aggregated using group_by(PA, Age_num) and summarise(TotalPop = sum(Pop)) to obtain total population per age and area combination.\n\nHeatmapcode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheatmap_df &lt;- clean_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA, Age_num) %&gt;%\n  summarise(TotalPop = sum(Pop), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nggplot(heatmap_df, aes(x = reorder(PA, -TotalPop), y = Age_num, fill = TotalPop)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"#f2f0f7\", high = \"#54278f\", name = \"Population\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Heatmap of Population by Age and Planning Area (2024)\",\n    x = \"Planning Area\",\n    y = \"Age\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight\n\n\n\nThe heatmap reveals that younger populations (ages 0–19) are more prevalent in towns like Punggol, Sengkang, and Jurong West, which are known for newer housing developments. In contrast, older populations (ages 65 and above) are concentrated in mature estates such as Toa Payoh, Bukit Merah, and Queenstown. These demographic patterns can guide resource allocation for education (schools, childcare) and healthcare (eldercare services) based on age concentrations in each area.\n\n\n\n\nEDA 2: Boxplot of Age Distribution by Region\nThis boxplot displays the age distribution of residents across selected regions in Singapore. Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR) — the middle 50% of the population — while the horizontal line inside the box indicates the median age. The whiskers extend to the lowest and highest non-outlier values, and outliers beyond these are also shown.\nTo account for differences in population size, the plot is weighted by the population count (Pop). Weighted quartiles (Q1, Median, Q3) were computed using the Hmisc::wtd.quantile() function and annotated on the plot for clearer interpretation.\n\nBoxplotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbox_df &lt;- clean_data %&gt;%\n  inner_join(region_map, by = \"PA\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Age_num = case_when(\n      str_detect(Age, \"100\") ~ 100,\n      str_detect(Age, \"90\") ~ 90,\n      str_detect(Age, \"^\\\\d+$\") ~ as.numeric(Age),\n      TRUE ~ NA_real_\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Age_num))\n\nquartiles_df &lt;- box_df %&gt;%\n  group_by(Region) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Q1 = wtd.quantile(Age_num, weights = Pop, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Median = wtd.quantile(Age_num, weights = Pop, probs = 0.5, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Q3 = wtd.quantile(Age_num, weights = Pop, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nggplot(box_df, aes(x = Region, y = Age_num)) +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(weight = Pop), fill = \"#FDC086\", color = \"#E07B39\") +\n  geom_text(data = quartiles_df, aes(x = Region, y = Q1, label = paste0(\"Q1: \", round(Q1))), \n            vjust = -1.5, size = 3) +\n  geom_text(data = quartiles_df, aes(x = Region, y = Median, label = paste0(\"Median: \", round(Median))), \n            vjust = -0.2, size = 3, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  geom_text(data = quartiles_df, aes(x = Region, y = Q3, label = paste0(\"Q3: \", round(Q3))), \n            vjust = 1.5, size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Boxplot of Age Distribution by Region\",\n    x = \"Region\",\n    y = \"Age\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight\n\n\n\nThe Central region shows the widest IQR and highest median age, suggesting a concentration of older residents in mature housing estates like Toa Payoh and Queenstown. In contrast, the East and North-East regions have narrower boxes and lower medians, indicating a younger demographic — likely linked to newer developments attracting young families. Outliers at the upper end of most regions reflect the presence of aging residents across the country, though at different levels of intensity.\n\n\n\n\nEDA 3: Ageing Index vs Youth Dependency Ratio by Planning Area (2024)\nThis bubble chart visualizes the demographic balance of Singapore’s planning areas by comparing two key ratios:\n\nAgeing Index (vertical axis): Elderly population relative to youth\nYouth Dependency Ratio (horizontal axis): Youth population relative to working-age adults\n\nEach bubble represents a planning area. Its position indicates the ageing structure, while the color reflects total population tier (Low, Medium, High). Bubble size corresponds to the total population, providing an additional layer of magnitude.\nThe chart highlights regional disparities in demographic pressures. This type of visual is particularly useful for public policy makers to simultaneously assess youth dependency and ageing pressure across local areas.\n\nBubble ChartCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nageing_df &lt;- clean_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Age_num = case_when(\n      str_detect(Age, \"100\") ~ 100,\n      str_detect(Age, \"90\") ~ 90,\n      str_detect(Age, \"^\\\\d+$\") ~ as.numeric(Age),\n      TRUE ~ NA_real_\n    ),\n    AgeGroup = case_when(\n      Age_num &lt;= 23 ~ \"Youth\",\n      Age_num &gt;= 65 ~ \"Elderly\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Working\"\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA, AgeGroup) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Population = sum(Pop), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = AgeGroup, values_from = Population, values_fill = 0) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Ageing_Index = Elderly / Youth,\n    Youth_Dependency = Youth / Working,\n    TotalPop = Elderly + Youth + Working,\n    PopGroup = case_when(\n      TotalPop &gt;= 200000 ~ \"High\",\n      TotalPop &gt;= 100000 ~ \"Medium\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Low\"\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(ageing_df, aes(x = Youth_Dependency, y = Ageing_Index, size = TotalPop, color = PopGroup, label = PA)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_text_repel(size = 3, max.overlaps = 12) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12), guide = \"none\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Low\" = \"#66c2a5\", \"Medium\" = \"#fc8d62\", \"High\" = \"#8da0cb\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Ageing Index vs Youth Dependency Ratio by Planning Area (2024)\",\n    x = \"Youth Dependency Ratio (Youth / Working Age)\",\n    y = \"Ageing Index (Elderly / Youth)\",\n    color = \"Population Tier\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight\n\n\n\nMature estates such as Bukit Timah, Marine Parade, and Toa Payoh exhibit high ageing indices, suggesting a significant elderly population relative to youth. In contrast, towns like Punggol and Sengkang have low ageing indices but high youth dependency ratios, indicating a younger demographic with more children per working adult. Bubble sizes show that Bedok, Tampines, and Jurong West have among the largest populations, making them key zones for age-targeted service delivery. This dual-axis visual helps forecast public service needs — from eldercare to early childhood education — based on population structure.\n\n\n\n\n4. Summary\nThis visual analytics project explored the demographic structure of Singapore in 2024 using three key static visualisations:\n\nA heatmap revealed how different age groups are distributed across planning areas, clearly showing that newer towns like Punggol and Sengkang are home to younger populations, while mature estates such as Toa Payoh and Queenstown have a larger concentration of elderly residents.\nA boxplot, weighted by population, illustrated the age distribution within selected regions. Central regions showed higher medians and wider age spread, suggesting aging communities, while East and North-East regions indicated younger, more uniform age profiles.\nA bubble chart compared ageing index and youth dependency ratio across planning areas. This dual-axis view allowed identification of towns experiencing demographic pressure from either end of the age spectrum. Towns like Punggol have high youth dependency, whereas places like Bukit Timah and Marine Parade show high ageing indices.\n\nTogether, these visualisations offer valuable insight into Singapore’s age distribution at both regional and town levels. They inform decisions in areas such as urban planning, healthcare infrastructure, school allocation, and social service delivery — ensuring policies are targeted to meet the evolving needs of the population.\n\n\n5.

Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\nThe code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.9 Geometric Objects: geom_point()\n_geom_point()- is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.10 geom objects can be combined\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)"

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\nHow to interpret Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.

    "section": "Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot",
    "text": "Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\nPlotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient().

    "text": "Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\nPlotting a Half Eye graph\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding the Dot Plots with stat_dots()\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinishing touch\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\nIntroducing Ridgeline Plots (formerly Joyplots)\nClaus O.

    "text": "Overview\nWhen telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\nBasic concepts of animation\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\nTerminology\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts."
