It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\n                         What is a statistical graphic?\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n\n1.4.1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n Reference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28."

    "text": "2.1 Overview\nIn this chapter, you will be introduced to several ggplot2 extensions for creating more elegant and effective statistical graphics. By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:\n\ncontrol the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in ggrepel package,\ncreate professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages,\nplot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using patchwork package.\n\n\n\n2.2 Getting started\n\n\n2.2.1 Installing and loading the required libraries\nIn this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:\n\nggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.\nggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’.\nhrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.\npatchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.\nCode chunk below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto your working R environment.\n\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggrepel, ggthemes, hrbrthemes, patchwork)\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Importing data\nFor the purpose of this exercise, a data file called Exam_data will be used. It consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.\nThe code chunk below imports exam_data.csv into R environment by using read_csv() function of readr package. readr is one of the tidyverse package.\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\nThere are a total of seven attributes in the exam_data tibble data frame.

If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.8 Geometric Objects: geom_violin\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\nThe code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.9 Geometric Objects: geom_point()\n_geom_point()- is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.10 geom objects can be combined\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)"
