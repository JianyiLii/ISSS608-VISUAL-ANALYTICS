Overview of Yihao’s Work and Data Preparation\nYihao’s take-home exercise investigates Singapore’s 2024 demographic structure through three visualisations:\n\nPopulation by Age and Sex\nPopulation by Age Group and Planning Area\nAging-to-Under-Age Population Ratio by Planning Area\n\nThese charts aim to explore gender imbalances across age groups, assess regional aging patterns, and evaluate the relative burden of aging populations.\nFor this peer review, I will focus on the first two visualisations only — Population by Age and Sex, and Population by Age Group and Planning Area — as they demonstrate distinct perspectives on demographic segmentation and regional trends.\nYihao’s data preparation is methodical and well-documented. The dataset was imported using read_csv() from the Department of Statistics Singapore. Key preprocessing steps include converting Age and Pop to numeric, recoding \"90_and_Over\" to \"90\", and verifying missing values using colSums(is.na(...)). These steps provide a clean and structured foundation for subsequent visual analysis.\n\npacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, \n               patchwork, DT, tidyverse) \n\n\nres_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/data.csv\")\n\n\nres_data %&gt;% filter(if_any(everything(), is.na))\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 6\n# ℹ 6 variables: PA &lt;chr&gt;, SZ &lt;chr&gt;, Age &lt;chr&gt;, Sex &lt;chr&gt;, Pop &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Time &lt;dbl&gt;\n\ncolSums(is.na(res_data))\n\n  PA   SZ  Age  Sex  Pop Time \n   0    0    0    0    0    0 \n\nres_data &lt;- res_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(Age = ifelse(Age == \"90_and_Over\", \"90\", Age),\n         Age = as.numeric(Age)) \n\nstr(res_data)\n\ntibble [60,424 × 6] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ PA  : chr [1:60424] \"Ang Mo Kio\" \"Ang Mo Kio\" \"Ang Mo Kio\" \"Ang Mo Kio\" ...\n $ SZ  : chr [1:60424] \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\" \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\" \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\" \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\" ...\n $ Age : num [1:60424] 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 ...\n $ Sex : chr [1:60424] \"Males\" \"Females\" \"Males\" \"Females\" ...\n $ Pop : num [1:60424] 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 30 10 ...\n $ Time: num [1:60424] 2024 2024 2024 2024 2024 ...\n\nres_data &lt;- res_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Age = as.numeric(Age),\n    Pop = as.numeric(Pop)\n  )\nstr(res_data)\n\ntibble [60,424 × 6] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ PA  : chr [1:60424] \"Ang Mo Kio\" \"Ang Mo Kio\" \"Ang Mo Kio\" \"Ang Mo Kio\" ...\n $ SZ  : chr [1:60424] \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\" \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\" \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\" \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\" ...\n $ Age : num [1:60424] 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 ...\n $ Sex : chr [1:60424] \"Males\" \"Females\" \"Males\" \"Females\" ...\n $ Pop : num [1:60424] 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 30 10 ...\n $ Time: num [1:60424] 2024 2024 2024 2024 2024 ...\n\n\n\n\n2. Exploratory Visual Analysis\n\n\nEVA 1: Population by Age and Sex\nStrengths:\n\nInnovative Visual Encoding\nYihao’s use of layered colored bars over a grey baseline to compare male and female populations by age is a creative and effective technique. It visually emphasizes gender differences in a way that is immediately understandable.\nClear Trend Identification\nThe chart successfully highlights a demographic pattern: males dominate in younger age groups (0–30), while females outnumber males in older age bands (30–90+). This is both accurately computed and clearly observed in the visual.\nEfficient Data Transformation\nThe process of reshaping the data using pivot_wider() and calculating male_extra and female_extra is handled cleanly. This preprocessing step sets the stage for the layered visualisation approach.\n\n\noriginal codeMakeover codeMakeover Chart\n\n\n\n\nClick to view code\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\ngrouped_data &lt;- res_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Age, Sex) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n\nwide_data &lt;- grouped_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Sex, values_from = Pop, values_fill = 0) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    min_pop = pmin(Males, Females),\n    male_extra = ifelse(Males &gt; Females, Males - Females, 0),\n    female_extra = ifelse(Females &gt; Males, Females - Males, 0)\n  )\n\n\nggplot() +\n\n  geom_col(data = wide_data, aes(x = Age, y = min_pop), \n           fill = \"gray70\", width = 0.6) +\n\n\n  geom_col(data = wide_data, aes(x = Age, y = male_extra), \n           fill = \"steelblue\", width = 0.6) +\n\n\n  geom_col(data = wide_data, aes(x = Age, y = female_extra), \n           fill = \"tomato\", width = 0.6) +\n\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population by Age and Sex\",\n    x = \"Age\",\n    y = \"Population\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to view code\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)      \nlibrary(viridisLite) \n\ngrouped_data &lt;- res_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Age, Sex) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nwide_data &lt;- grouped_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Sex, values_from = Pop, values_fill = 0) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    min_pop = pmin(Males, Females),\n    male_extra = ifelse(Males &gt; Females, Males - Females, 0),\n    female_extra = ifelse(Females &gt; Males, Females - Males, 0)\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_col(data = wide_data, aes(x = Age, y = min_pop), \n           fill = \"grey80\", width = 0.6) +\n\n  geom_col(data = wide_data, aes(x = Age, y = male_extra), \n           fill = viridis(3)[1], width = 0.6) +\n\n  geom_col(data = wide_data, aes(x = Age, y = female_extra), \n           fill = viridis(3)[3], width = 0.6) +\n\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population by Age and Sex (2024)\",\n    subtitle = \"Grey = shared population, Blue = Male surplus, Yellow = Female surplus\",\n    x = \"Age\",\n    y = \"Population Count\",\n    caption = \"Data: Singapore Department of Statistics (June 2024)\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, margin = margin(b = 10)),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart shows the relative percentage of male and female residents across each age group. The data was first grouped by age and sex, then the population in each sex group was divided by the total population in that age to compute the gender composition.\nUnlike the earlier visual (which showed raw population differences), this version uses a normalized scale (0–100%). It allows readers to clearly see which age groups are more gender-balanced and where one gender dominates in proportion — regardless of actual size.\n\n\nAges 0–29 show a slight male majority, indicating male-dominant birth cohorts or younger male migration.\nFrom age 30 onwards, females increasingly dominate, especially beyond age 60 — a pattern consistent with higher female life expectancy.\nThe crossover point — where the female proportion begins to exceed male — occurs around age 30, reinforcing the findings from the earlier absolute comparison chart.\n\nThis proportional view enhances the demographic story by highlighting gender imbalance dynamics relative to each age group, useful for understanding long-term trends in healthcare demand and social support planning.\n\n\n\nClick to view code\ncomposition_data &lt;- res_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Age, Sex) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Age) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percent = Pop / sum(Pop)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\nggplot(composition_data, aes(x = Age, y = Percent, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"fill\", width = 0.8) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Males\" = \"#1f77b4\", \"Females\" = \"#ff7f0e\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Gender Composition by Age Group (2024)\",\n    subtitle = \"Proportion of males and females across each age\",\n    x = \"Age\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    fill = \"Gender\",\n    caption = \"Data: Singapore Department of Statistics (June 2024)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, margin = margin(b = 10)),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestions for Improvement\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Clear Legend or Annotation\nWhile the color scheme is intuitive (steelblue for males, tomato for females), the chart lacks a legend or explicit note explaining what the colors represent. Adding a legend would enhance interpretability.\nEnhance Visual Accessibility\nConsider using a color-blind friendly palette or patterns to differentiate between the bars. This ensures accessibility for all readers.\nInclude a Normalized Comparison Option\nWhile the visual shows absolute differences, adding a secondary visual or facet that presents percentage distribution by age group (e.g., % males vs. % females per age) could provide additional analytical value.\n\n\n\n\n\nEVA 2: Population by Age Group and Planning Area\nStrengths:\n\nClear Age Segmentation Strategy\nYihao categorizes age into three intuitive groups — Under Age, Adult, and Aging. This simplifies the analysis and allows for high-level comparisons across planning areas.\nClean and Readable Bar Chart Design\nThe horizontal bar chart layout, with planning areas on the y-axis, is a smart choice for comparing numerous geographic areas. The ordering of bars by population supports fast scanning of highest and lowest regions.\nAdditional Ratio Analysis\nYihao extends the analysis beyond counts by calculating the Aging-to-Under-Age Ratio, offering deeper insights into demographic pressure. This demonstrates good analytical thinking beyond surface-level observations.\n\n\noriginal codeMakeover code\n\n\n\n\nClick to view code\nres_data_grouped &lt;- res_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(AgeGroup = case_when(\n    Age &gt;= 0 & Age &lt;= 20 ~ \"Under Age\",\n    Age &gt;= 21 & Age &lt;= 60 ~ \"Adult\",\n    Age &gt;= 61 ~ \"Aging\"\n  )) %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA, AgeGroup) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nres_data_grouped_filtered &lt;- res_data_grouped %&gt;%\n  filter(AgeGroup != \"Adult\")\n\nggplot(res_data_grouped_filtered, aes(x = Pop, y = reorder(PA, Pop), fill = AgeGroup)) +\n  geom_col(position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), width = 0.4) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population by Age Group and Planning Area\",\n    x = \"Population\",\n    y = \"Planning Area\",\n    fill = \"Age Group\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(expand = expansion(mult = c(0.4, 0.4))) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 3, margin = margin(r = 5)), \n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to view code\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\nres_data_grouped &lt;- res_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    AgeGroup = case_when(\n      Age &lt;= 14 ~ \"Youth\",\n      Age &gt;= 65 ~ \"Elderly\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Working\"\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA, AgeGroup) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(PA), !is.na(AgeGroup))\n\npa_top25 &lt;- res_data_grouped %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total = sum(Pop)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Total)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 25) %&gt;%\n  pull(PA)\n\nres_data_percent &lt;- res_data_grouped %&gt;%\n  filter(PA %in% pa_top25) %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percent = Pop / sum(Pop)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nelderly_order &lt;- res_data_percent %&gt;%\n  filter(AgeGroup == \"Elderly\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Percent)) %&gt;%\n  pull(PA)\n\nres_data_percent$PA &lt;- factor(res_data_percent$PA, levels = elderly_order)\n\nggplot(res_data_percent, aes(x = PA, y = Percent, fill = AgeGroup)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.8) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Youth\" = \"#66c2a5\", \"Working\" = \"#fc8d62\", \"Elderly\" = \"#8da0cb\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Age Group Composition by Planning Area (Top 25 by Population)\",\n    subtitle = \"Filtered and sorted by Elderly Population Share\",\n    x = \"Planning Area\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Total Population\",\n    fill = \"Age Group\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 9),\n    legend.position = \"top\",\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9),\n    plot.margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestions for Improvement\n\n\n\n\nRefined Age Group Boundaries\nAge categories were updated to follow standard definitions:\n\nYouth: 0–14\nWorking: 15–64\nElderly: 65+ This ensures alignment with demographic research and public policy frameworks.\n\nImproved Visual Readability\nThe chart was filtered to show only the top 25 most populated planning areas to reduce clutter. Font size for axis labels was increased (size = 9) and coord_flip() was applied to present the labels horizontally, improving label legibility.\nIncorporated Proportional Representation\nInstead of plotting absolute values, the chart now shows percentage composition by age group using a 100% stacked bar format. This enables fairer comparison across areas with different total population sizes and highlights structural age group differences.\nReordered Planning Areas by Elderly Share\nThe bars were sorted based on the proportion of elderly residents in each area, which strengthens the narrative focus and draws attention to aging population hotspots.\nApplied Colorblind-Friendly Palette\nManual color selection was updated using a palette suitable for broader accessibility, improving visual contrast between age groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nYuan Yihao\nTake-home exercise 1"

You will learn more about the color scheme in sub-section 4.4.\nBy default, Missing value will be shaded in grey.\n\n\n\nDrawing a choropleth map using tm_fill() and *tm_border()**\nActually, tm_polygons() is a wraper of tm_fill() and tm_border(). tm_fill() shades the polygons by using the default colour scheme and tm_borders() adds the borders of the shapefile onto the choropleth map.\nThe code chunk below draws a choropleth map by using tm_fill() alone.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the planning subzones are shared according to the respective dependecy values\nTo add the boundary of the planning subzones, tm_borders will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"DEPENDENCY\") +\n  tm_borders(lwd = 0.01,  \n             fill_alpha = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that light-gray border lines have been added on the choropleth map.\nThe alpha argument is used to define transparency number between 0 (totally transparent) and 1 (not transparent). By default, the alpha value of the col is used (normally 1).\nBeside alpha argument, there are three other arguments for tm_borders(), they are:\n\ncol = border colour,\nlwd = border line width. The default is 1, and\nlty = border line type. The default is “solid”.\n\n\n\n\nData classification methods of tmap\nMost choropleth maps employ some methods of data classification. The point of classification is to take a large number of observations and group them into data ranges or classes.\ntmap provides a total ten data classification methods, namely: fixed, sd, equal, pretty (default), quantile, kmeans, hclust, bclust, fisher, and jenks.\nTo define a data classification method, the style argument of tm_fill() or tm_polygons() will be used.\n\nPlotting choropleth maps with built-in classification methods\nThe code chunk below shows a quantile data classification that used 5 classes.\n\n\nClick to view code\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n      fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n        style = \"jenks\",\n        n = 5)) +\n  tm_borders(fill_alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, equal data classification method is used.\n\n\nClick to view code\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n      fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n        style = \"equal\",\n        n = 5)) +\n  tm_borders(fill_alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution of quantile data classification method are more evenly distributed then equal data classification method.\n\nWarning: Maps Lie!\n\n\nDIY: Using what you had learned, prepare choropleth maps by using different classification methods supported by tmap and compare their differences.\n\n\nDIY: Preparing choropleth maps by using similar classification method but with different numbers of classes (i.e. 2, 6, 10, 20). Compare the output maps, what observation can you draw?\n\n\n\nPlotting choropleth map with custome break\nFor all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. In order to override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the breaks argument to the tm_fill(). It is important to note that, in tmap the breaks include a minimum and maximum. As a result, in order to end up with n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the breaks option (the values must be in increasing order).\nBefore we get started, it is always a good practice to get some descriptive statistics on the variable before setting the break points. Code chunk below will be used to compute and display the descriptive statistics of DEPENDENCY field.\n\nsummary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.1111  0.7147  0.7866  0.8585  0.8763 19.0000      92 \n\n\nWith reference to the results above, we set break point at 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. In addition, we also need to include a minimum and maximum, which we set at 0 and 100. Our breaks vector is thus c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)\nNow, we will plot the choropleth map by using the code chunk below.\n\n\nClick to view code\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          breaks = c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)) +\n  tm_borders(fill_alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColour Scheme\ntmap supports colour ramps either defined by the user or a set of predefined colour ramps from the RColorBrewer package.\n\nUsing ColourBrewer palette\nTo change the colour, we assign the preferred colour to palette argument of tm_fill() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\nClick to view code\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n      fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n        style = \"quantile\",\n        n = 5,\n        values = \"brewer.greens\")) +\n  tm_borders(fill_alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth map is shaded in green.\nTo reverse the colour shading, add a “-” prefix.\n\n\nClick to view code\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n      fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n        style = \"quantile\",\n        n = 5,\n        values = \"-brewer.greens\")) +\n  tm_borders(fill_alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the colour scheme has been reversed.\n\n\n\nMap Layouts\nMap layout refers to the combination of all map elements into a cohensive map. Map elements include among others the objects to be mapped, the title, the scale bar, the compass, margins and aspects ratios. Colour settings and data classification methods covered in the previous section relate to the palette and break-points are used to affect how the map looks.\n\nMap Legend\nIn tmap, several legend options are provided to change the placement, format and appearance of the legend.\n\n\nClick to view code\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n      fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n        style = \"jenks\",\n        n = 5,\n        values = \"brewer.greens\"),\n      fill.legend = tm_legend(\n        title = \"Dependency ratio\")) +\n  tm_borders(fill_alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_title(\"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone \\n(Jenks classification)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap style\ntmap allows a wide variety of layout settings to be changed. They can be called by using tmap_style().\nThe code chunk below shows the classic style is used.\n\n\nClick to view code\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"classic\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCartographic Furniture\nBeside map style, tmap also also provides arguments to draw other map furniture such as compass, scale bar and grid lines.\nIn the code chunk below, tm_compass(), tm_scale_bar() and tm_grid() are used to add compass, scale bar and grid lines onto the choropleth map.\n\n\nClick to view code\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"DEPENDENCY\", \n              fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n                style = \"quantile\",\n                n = 5,\n                values = \"brewer.blues\"),\n              fill.legend = tm_legend(\n                title = \"Dependency ratio\")) +\n  tm_title(\"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone\") +\n  tm_layout(frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(fill_alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reset the default style, refer to the code chunk below.\n\ntmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\nDrawing Small Multiple Choropleth Maps\nSmall multiple maps, also referred to as facet maps, are composed of many maps arrange side-by-side, and sometimes stacked vertically. Small multiple maps enable the visualisation of how spatial relationships change with respect to another variable, such as time.\nIn tmap, small multiple maps can be plotted in three ways:\n\nby assigning multiple values to at least one of the asthetic arguments,\nby defining a group-by variable in tm_facets(), and\nby creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\n\nBy assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by defining ncols in tm_fill()\n\n\nClick to view code\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(c(\"YOUNG\", \"AGED\"),\n          style = \"equal\", \n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments\n\n\nClick to view code\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(c(\"DEPENDENCY\",\"AGED\"),\n          style = c(\"equal\", \"quantile\"), \n          palette = list(\"Blues\",\"Greens\")) +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy defining a group-by variable in tm_facets()\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by using tm_facets().\n\n\nClick to view code\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          thres.poly = 0) + \n  tm_facets(by=\"REGION_N\", \n            free.coords=TRUE) +\n  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE,\n            title.position = c(\"center\", \"center\"), \n            title.size = 20) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange()\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\n\nClick to view code\nyoungmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(\"YOUNG\", \n              style = \"quantile\", \n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\nagedmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(\"AGED\", \n              style = \"quantile\", \n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\ntmap_arrange(youngmap, agedmap, asp=1, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMappping Spatial Object Meeting a Selection Criterion\nInstead of creating small multiple choropleth map, you can also use selection funtion to map spatial objects meeting the selection criterion.\n\n\nClick to view code\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020[mpsz_pop2020$REGION_N==\"CENTRAL REGION\", ])+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\", \n          legend.hist = TRUE, \n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 5.0,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)"

    "text": "2.1 Overview\nIn this chapter, you will be introduced to several ggplot2 extensions for creating more elegant and effective statistical graphics. By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:\n\ncontrol the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in ggrepel package,\ncreate professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages,\nplot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using patchwork package.\n\n\n\n2.2 Getting started\n\n\n2.2.1 Installing and loading the required libraries\nIn this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:\n\nggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.\nggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’.\nhrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.\npatchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.\nCode chunk below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto your working R environment.\n\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggrepel, ggthemes, hrbrthemes, patchwork)\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Importing data\nFor the purpose of this exercise, a data file called Exam_data will be used. It consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.\nThe code chunk below imports exam_data.csv into R environment by using read_csv() function of readr package. readr is one of the tidyverse package.\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\nThere are a total of seven attributes in the exam_data tibble data frame. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.\n\nThe categorical attributes are: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.\nThe continuous attributes are: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.\n\n\n\n2.3 Beyond ggplot2 Annotation: ggrepel\nOne of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  geom_label(aes(label = ID), \n             hjust = .5, \n             vjust = -.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\n\n\n\nggrepel is an extension of ggplot2 package which provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text as in our examples on the right.  We simply replace geom_text() by geom_text_repel() and geom_label() by geom_label_repel.\n\n\n2.3.1 Working with ggrepel\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ID), \n                   fontface = \"bold\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Beyond ggplot2 Themes\nggplot2 comes with eight built-in themes, they are: theme_gray(), theme_bw(), theme_classic(), theme_dark(), theme_light(), theme_linedraw(), theme_minimal(), and theme_void().\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  theme_gray() +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") \n\n\n\n\nRefer to this link to learn more about ggplot2 Themes\n\n\n2.4.1 Working with ggtheme package\nggthemes provides ‘ggplot2’ themes that replicate the look of plots by Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, Fivethirtyeight, The Economist, ‘Stata’, ‘Excel’, and The Wall Street Journal, among others.\nIn the example below, The Economist theme is used.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") +\n  theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\nIt also provides some extra geoms and scales for ‘ggplot2’.

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nWhen telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\nBasic concepts of animation\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\nTerminology\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts."

    "section": "Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot",
    "text": "Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\nPlotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

    "text": "Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\nPlotting a Half Eye graph\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2.

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\nHow to interpret Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.

    "text": "Creating network objects using tidygraph\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a graph data model by using tidygraph package. It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\nBefore getting started, you are advised to read these two articles:\n\nIntroducing tidygraph\ntidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope\n\n\nThe tbl_graph object\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\n\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\nThe dplyr verbs in tidygraph\n\nactivate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\n\n\nIn the above the .N() function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data. Similarly .E() will give you the edge data and .G() will give you the tbl_graph object itself.\n\n\n\nUsing tbl_graph() to build tidygraph data model.\nIn this section, you will use tbl_graph() of tinygraph package to build an tidygraph’s network graph data.frame.\nBefore typing the codes, you are recommended to review to reference guide of tbl_graph()\n\n\nClick to view code\nGAStech_graph &lt;- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,\n                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, \n                           directed = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nReviewing the output tidygraph’s graph object\n\n\nClick to view code\nGAStech_graph\n\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4 (active)\n      id label               Department     Title                               \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                               \n 1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                    \n 2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                    \n 3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                    \n 4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                    \n 5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Mana…\n 6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager       \n 7     7 Cornelia.Lais       Administration Assistant to Security Group Manager \n 8    44 Kanon.Herrero       Security       Badging Office                      \n 9    45 Varja.Lagos         Security       Badging Office                      \n10    46 Stenig.Fusil        Security       Building Control                    \n# ℹ 44 more rows\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     2 Sunday       5\n2     1     2 Monday       2\n3     1     2 Tuesday      3\n# ℹ 1,369 more rows\n\n\n\n\nReviewing the output tidygraph’s graph object\n\nThe output above reveals that GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges.\nThe command also prints the first six rows of “Node Data” and the first three of “Edge Data”.\nIt states that the Node Data is active. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\n\n\nChanging the active object\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the activate() function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest “weight” first, we could use activate() and then arrange().\nFor example,\n\n\nClick to view code\nGAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  activate(edges) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n\n\nVisit the reference guide of activate() to find out more about the function."

    "section": "Extreme Value Maps",
    "text": "Extreme Value Maps\nExtreme value maps are variations of common choropleth maps where the classification is designed to highlight extreme values at the lower and upper end of the scale, with the goal of identifying outliers. These maps were developed in the spirit of spatializing EDA, i.e., adding spatial features to commonly used approaches in non-spatial EDA (Anselin 1994).\n\nPercentile Map\nThe percentile map is a special type of quantile map with six specific categories: 0-1%,1-10%, 10-50%,50-90%,90-99%, and 99-100%. The corresponding breakpoints can be derived by means of the base R quantile command, passing an explicit vector of cumulative probabilities as c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1). Note that the begin and endpoint need to be included.\n\nData Preparation\nStep 1: Exclude records with NA by using the code chunk below.\n\n\nNGA_wp &lt;- NGA_wp %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\n\nStep 2: Creating customised classification and extracting values\n\npercent &lt;- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)\nvar &lt;- NGA_wp[\"pct_functional\"] %&gt;%\n  st_set_geometry(NULL)\nquantile(var[,1], percent)\n\n       0%        1%       10%       50%       90%       99%      100% \n0.0000000 0.0000000 0.2169811 0.4791667 0.8611111 1.0000000 1.0000000 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen variables are extracted from an sf data.frame, the geometry is extracted as well. For mapping and spatial manipulation, this is the expected behavior, but many base R functions cannot deal with the geometry. Specifically, the quantile() gives an error. As a result st_set_geomtry(NULL) is used to drop geomtry field.\n\n\n\n\nWhy writing functions?\nWriting a function has three big advantages over using copy-and-paste:\n\nYou can give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand.\nAs requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, instead of many.\nYou eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another).\n\nSource: Chapter 19: Functions of R for Data Science.\n\n\nCreating the get.var function\nFirstly, we will write an R function as shown below to extract a variable (i.e. wp_nonfunctional) as a vector out of an sf data.frame.\n\narguments:\n\nvname: variable name (as character, in quotes)\ndf: name of sf data frame\n\nreturns:\n\nv: vector with values (without a column name)\n\n\n\nget.var &lt;- function(vname,df) {\n  v &lt;- df[vname] %&gt;% \n    st_set_geometry(NULL)\n  v &lt;- unname(v[,1])\n  return(v)\n}\n\n\n\nA percentile mapping function\nNext, we will write a percentile mapping function by using the code chunk below.\n\n\nClick to view code\npercentmap &lt;- function(vnam, df, legtitle=NA, mtitle=\"Percentile Map\"){\n  percent &lt;- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)\n  var &lt;- get.var(vnam, df)\n  bperc &lt;- quantile(var, percent)\n  tm_shape(df) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(df) +\n     tm_polygons(vnam,\n             title=legtitle,\n             breaks=bperc,\n             palette=\"Blues\",\n          labels=c(\"&lt; 1%\", \"1% - 10%\", \"10% - 50%\", \"50% - 90%\", \"90% - 99%\", \"&gt; 99%\"))  +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_layout(main.title = mtitle, \n            title.position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\"))\n}\n\n\n\n\nTest drive the percentile mapping function\nTo run the function, type the code chunk as shown below.\n\npercentmap(\"total_wp\", NGA_wp)\n\n\n\n\nNote that this is just a bare bones implementation. Additional arguments such as the title, legend positioning just to name a few of them, could be passed to customise various features of the map.\n\n\n\nBox map\nIn essence, a box map is an augmented quartile map, with an additional lower and upper category. When there are lower outliers, then the starting point for the breaks is the minimum value, and the second break is the lower fence. In contrast, when there are no lower outliers, then the starting point for the breaks will be the lower fence, and the second break is the minimum value (there will be no observations that fall in the interval between the lower fence and the minimum value).\n\nggplot(data = NGA_wp,\n       aes(x = \"\",\n           y = wp_nonfunctional)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying summary statistics on a choropleth map by using the basic principles of boxplot.\nTo create a box map, a custom breaks specification will be used. However, there is a complication. The break points for the box map vary depending on whether lower or upper outliers are present.\n\n\nCreating the boxbreaks function\nThe code chunk below is an R function that creating break points for a box map.\n\narguments:\n\nv: vector with observations\nmult: multiplier for IQR (default 1.5)\n\nreturns:\n\nbb: vector with 7 break points compute quartile and fences\n\n\n\n\nClick to view code\nboxbreaks &lt;- function(v,mult=1.5) {\n  qv &lt;- unname(quantile(v))\n  iqr &lt;- qv[4] - qv[2]\n  upfence &lt;- qv[4] + mult * iqr\n  lofence &lt;- qv[2] - mult * iqr\n  # initialize break points vector\n  bb &lt;- vector(mode=\"numeric\",length=7)\n  # logic for lower and upper fences\n  if (lofence &lt; qv[1]) {  # no lower outliers\n    bb[1] &lt;- lofence\n    bb[2] &lt;- floor(qv[1])\n  } else {\n    bb[2] &lt;- lofence\n    bb[1] &lt;- qv[1]\n  }\n  if (upfence &gt; qv[5]) { # no upper outliers\n    bb[7] &lt;- upfence\n    bb[6] &lt;- ceiling(qv[5])\n  } else {\n    bb[6] &lt;- upfence\n    bb[7] &lt;- qv[5]\n  }\n  bb[3:5] &lt;- qv[2:4]\n  return(bb)\n}\n\n\n\n\nCreating the get.var function\nThe code chunk below is an R function to extract a variable as a vector out of an sf data frame.\n\narguments:\n\nvname: variable name (as character, in quotes)\ndf: name of sf data frame\n\nreturns:\n\nv: vector with values (without a column name)\n\n\n\nget.var &lt;- function(vname,df) {\n  v &lt;- df[vname] %&gt;% st_set_geometry(NULL)\n  v &lt;- unname(v[,1])\n  return(v)\n}\n\n\n\nTest drive the newly created function\nLet’s test the newly created function\n\nvar &lt;- get.var(\"wp_nonfunctional\", NGA_wp) \nboxbreaks(var)\n\n[1] -56.5   0.0  14.0  34.0  61.0 131.5 278.0\n\n\n\n\nBoxmap function\nThe code chunk below is an R function to create a box map. - arguments: - vnam: variable name (as character, in quotes) - df: simple features polygon layer - legtitle: legend title - mtitle: map title - mult: multiplier for IQR - returns: - a tmap-element (plots a map)\n\n\nClick to view code\nboxmap &lt;- function(vnam, df, \n                   legtitle=NA,\n                   mtitle=\"Box Map\",\n                   mult=1.5){\n  var &lt;- get.var(vnam,df)\n  bb &lt;- boxbreaks(var)\n  tm_shape(df) +\n    tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(df) +\n     tm_fill(vnam,title=legtitle,\n             breaks=bb,\n             palette=\"Blues\",\n          labels = c(\"lower outlier\", \n                     \"&lt; 25%\", \n                     \"25% - 50%\", \n                     \"50% - 75%\",\n                     \"&gt; 75%\", \n                     \"upper outlier\"))  +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_layout(main.title = mtitle, \n            title.position = c(\"left\",\n                               \"top\"))\n}\n\n\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\nboxmap(\"wp_nonfunctional\", NGA_wp)"

Overview\n\n1.1 Setting the Scene\nA local online media company that publishes daily content on digital platforms is planning to release an article on demographic structures and distribution of Singapore in 2024. Singapore’s population landscape is constantly evolving due to demographic shifts such as aging, fertility trends, and migration. Understanding the distribution of residents by age, gender, and location is crucial for informed urban planning, resource allocation, and policy formulation. This exercise aims to visualise the 2024 demographic structure and spatial distribution of Singapore residents across planning areas and subzones. Through visual analytics, we seek to uncover meaningful patterns and insights that support public awareness and strategic decision-making.\n\n\n1.2 Task and Objective\nAssuming the role of the graphical editor of the media company, our tasked to prepare at most three data visualisation for the article. The objective of this analysis is to uncover regional population patterns and age composition trends across planning areas in 2024 using visual analytics. Specifically, we aim to:\n\nIdentify age concentrations across planning areas via a heatmap.\nExplore regional disparities in age distribution using boxplots.\nExamine population ageing and youth dependency dynamics through bubble charts.\n\nThese insights will help policymakers and urban planners to design age-targeted strategies that align with the demographic characteristics of each region.\n\n\n1.3 Data Description\nThe dataset used in this study is sourced from the Singapore Department of Statistics and titled “Singapore Residents by Planning Area/Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2024.” It contains information on resident population counts broken down by:\n\nPA —&gt; Planning Area\nSZ —&gt; Subzone\nPop —&gt; Population\nAge\nSex ––&gt; Male or Female\nTime ––&gt; Year of data (2024)\n\n\n\n2.

Exploratory Visual Analysis\n\n\nEDA 1: Heatmap of Population by Age and Planning Area (2024)\nThis heatmap visualizes the total population across different planning areas in Singapore by age. Each row represents a single age (e.g., 0 to 100), and each column corresponds to a planning area. The intensity of color indicates the number of residents in a specific age group within each planning area. Darker shades represent higher population counts, allowing for easy visual comparison of population structure across locations.\nThe data was pre-aggregated using group_by(PA, Age_num) and summarise(TotalPop = sum(Pop)) to obtain total population per age and area combination.\n\nHeatmapcode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheatmap_df &lt;- clean_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA, Age_num) %&gt;%\n  summarise(TotalPop = sum(Pop), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nggplot(heatmap_df, aes(x = reorder(PA, -TotalPop), y = Age_num, fill = TotalPop)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"#f2f0f7\", high = \"#54278f\", name = \"Population\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Heatmap of Population by Age and Planning Area (2024)\",\n    x = \"Planning Area\",\n    y = \"Age\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight\n\n\n\nThe heatmap reveals that younger populations (ages 0–19) are more prevalent in towns like Punggol, Sengkang, and Jurong West, which are known for newer housing developments. In contrast, older populations (ages 65 and above) are concentrated in mature estates such as Toa Payoh, Bukit Merah, and Queenstown. These demographic patterns can guide resource allocation for education (schools, childcare) and healthcare (eldercare services) based on age concentrations in each area.\n\n\n\n\nEDA 2: Boxplot of Age Distribution by Region\nThis boxplot displays the age distribution of residents across selected regions in Singapore. Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR) — the middle 50% of the population — while the horizontal line inside the box indicates the median age. The whiskers extend to the lowest and highest non-outlier values, and outliers beyond these are also shown.\nTo account for differences in population size, the plot is weighted by the population count (Pop). Weighted quartiles (Q1, Median, Q3) were computed using the Hmisc::wtd.quantile() function and annotated on the plot for clearer interpretation.\n\nBoxplotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbox_df &lt;- clean_data %&gt;%\n  inner_join(region_map, by = \"PA\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Age_num = case_when(\n      str_detect(Age, \"100\") ~ 100,\n      str_detect(Age, \"90\") ~ 90,\n      str_detect(Age, \"^\\\\d+$\") ~ as.numeric(Age),\n      TRUE ~ NA_real_\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Age_num))\n\nquartiles_df &lt;- box_df %&gt;%\n  group_by(Region) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Q1 = wtd.quantile(Age_num, weights = Pop, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Median = wtd.quantile(Age_num, weights = Pop, probs = 0.5, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Q3 = wtd.quantile(Age_num, weights = Pop, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nggplot(box_df, aes(x = Region, y = Age_num)) +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(weight = Pop), fill = \"#FDC086\", color = \"#E07B39\") +\n  geom_text(data = quartiles_df, aes(x = Region, y = Q1, label = paste0(\"Q1: \", round(Q1))), \n            vjust = -1.5, size = 3) +\n  geom_text(data = quartiles_df, aes(x = Region, y = Median, label = paste0(\"Median: \", round(Median))), \n            vjust = -0.2, size = 3, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  geom_text(data = quartiles_df, aes(x = Region, y = Q3, label = paste0(\"Q3: \", round(Q3))), \n            vjust = 1.5, size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Boxplot of Age Distribution by Region\",\n    x = \"Region\",\n    y = \"Age\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight\n\n\n\nThe Central region shows the widest IQR and highest median age, suggesting a concentration of older residents in mature housing estates like Toa Payoh and Queenstown. In contrast, the East and North-East regions have narrower boxes and lower medians, indicating a younger demographic — likely linked to newer developments attracting young families. Outliers at the upper end of most regions reflect the presence of aging residents across the country, though at different levels of intensity.\n\n\n\n\nEDA 3: Ageing Index vs Youth Dependency Ratio by Planning Area (2024)\nThis bubble chart visualizes the demographic balance of Singapore’s planning areas by comparing two key ratios:\n\nAgeing Index (vertical axis): Elderly population relative to youth\nYouth Dependency Ratio (horizontal axis): Youth population relative to working-age adults\n\nEach bubble represents a planning area. Its position indicates the ageing structure, while the color reflects total population tier (Low, Medium, High). Bubble size corresponds to the total population, providing an additional layer of magnitude.\nThe chart highlights regional disparities in demographic pressures. This type of visual is particularly useful for public policy makers to simultaneously assess youth dependency and ageing pressure across local areas.\n\nBubble ChartCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nageing_df &lt;- clean_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Age_num = case_when(\n      str_detect(Age, \"100\") ~ 100,\n      str_detect(Age, \"90\") ~ 90,\n      str_detect(Age, \"^\\\\d+$\") ~ as.numeric(Age),\n      TRUE ~ NA_real_\n    ),\n    AgeGroup = case_when(\n      Age_num &lt;= 23 ~ \"Youth\",\n      Age_num &gt;= 65 ~ \"Elderly\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Working\"\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA, AgeGroup) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Population = sum(Pop), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = AgeGroup, values_from = Population, values_fill = 0) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Ageing_Index = Elderly / Youth,\n    Youth_Dependency = Youth / Working,\n    TotalPop = Elderly + Youth + Working,\n    PopGroup = case_when(\n      TotalPop &gt;= 200000 ~ \"High\",\n      TotalPop &gt;= 100000 ~ \"Medium\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Low\"\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(ageing_df, aes(x = Youth_Dependency, y = Ageing_Index, size = TotalPop, color = PopGroup, label = PA)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_text_repel(size = 3, max.overlaps = 12) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12), guide = \"none\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Low\" = \"#66c2a5\", \"Medium\" = \"#fc8d62\", \"High\" = \"#8da0cb\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Ageing Index vs Youth Dependency Ratio by Planning Area (2024)\",\n    x = \"Youth Dependency Ratio (Youth / Working Age)\",\n    y = \"Ageing Index (Elderly / Youth)\",\n    color = \"Population Tier\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight\n\n\n\nMature estates such as Bukit Timah, Marine Parade, and Toa Payoh exhibit high ageing indices, suggesting a significant elderly population relative to youth. In contrast, towns like Punggol and Sengkang have low ageing indices but high youth dependency ratios, indicating a younger demographic with more children per working adult. Bubble sizes show that Bedok, Tampines, and Jurong West have among the largest populations, making them key zones for age-targeted service delivery. This dual-axis visual helps forecast public service needs — from eldercare to early childhood education — based on population structure.\n\n\n\n\n4. Summary\nThis visual analytics project explored the demographic structure of Singapore in 2024 using three key static visualisations:\n\nA heatmap revealed how different age groups are distributed across planning areas, clearly showing that newer towns like Punggol and Sengkang are home to younger populations, while mature estates such as Toa Payoh and Queenstown have a larger concentration of elderly residents.\nA boxplot, weighted by population, illustrated the age distribution within selected regions. Central regions showed higher medians and wider age spread, suggesting aging communities, while East and North-East regions indicated younger, more uniform age profiles.\nA bubble chart compared ageing index and youth dependency ratio across planning areas. This dual-axis view allowed identification of towns experiencing demographic pressure from either end of the age spectrum. Towns like Punggol have high youth dependency, whereas places like Bukit Timah and Marine Parade show high ageing indices.\n\nTogether, these visualisations offer valuable insight into Singapore’s age distribution at both regional and town levels. They inform decisions in areas such as urban planning, healthcare infrastructure, school allocation, and social service delivery — ensuring policies are targeted to meet the evolving needs of the population.\n\n\n5.
