<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, the community of Oceanus has faced numerous transformations and challenges evolving from its fishing-centric origins. Following major crackdowns on illegal fishing activities, suspects have shifted investments into more regulated sectors such as the ocean tourism industry, resulting in growing tensions. This increased tourism has recently attracted the likes of international pop star Sailor Shift, who announced plans to film a music video on the island.</p>
<p>Clepper Jessen, a former analyst at FishEye and now a seasoned journalist for the Hacklee Herald, has been keenly observing these rising tensions. Recently, he turned his attention towards the temporary closure of Nemo Reef. By listening to radio communications and utilizing his investigative tools, Clepper uncovered a complex web of expedited approvals and secretive logistics. These efforts revealed a story involving high-level Oceanus officials, Sailor Shift’s team, local influential families, and local conservationist group The Green Guardians, pointing towards a story of corruption and manipulation.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-preparation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-preparation">Data Preparation</h3>
<p>To begin our investigation, we loaded the essential libraries for data processing and network visualization using the <code>pacman</code> package, which simplifies package loading. The following libraries were used:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>pacman<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">p_load</span>(tidyverse, jsonlite, tidygraph, ggraph, lubridate, kableExtra)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><code>tidyverse</code>: for data wrangling and manipulation</li>
<li><code>jsonlite</code>: for reading JSON files</li>
<li><code>tidygraph</code> and <code>ggraph</code>: for network graph operations and visualization</li>
<li><code>lubridate</code>: for handling temporal variables</li>
<li><code>kableExtra</code>: for optional table rendering</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we imported the knowledge graph data provided in JSON format using the fromJSON() function. The file MC3_graph.json was flattened for easier access to nested structures.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(jsonlite)</span>

</div>
<p>The imported graph structure contains two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nodes</code>: representing entities such as people, vessels, locations, events, etc.</li>
<li><code>edges</code>: representing interactions or communications between these entities.</li>
</ul>
<p>These were extracted for further cleaning and analysis:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>nodes <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> graph_data<span class="sc">$</span>nodes</span>

</div>
<p>We examined the column names of both nodes and edges using:</p>
<div class="cell">

<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">colnames</span>(edges)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>

</div>
</div>
<p>This helped us understand the data schema, which guided all subsequent filtering and analysis procedures.</p>
<p>To ensure compatibility with tidygraph and prevent downstream join issues, we began by ensuring that the <code>id</code>, <code>source</code>, and <code>target</code> fields were of character type. This is important because some of the IDs were stored as integers in the original JSON structure.</p>

<p>Before building the graph, we needed to ensure that all edges refer to valid nodes. This prevents errors in <code>tidygraph</code> when mapping the graph structure.</p>
<p>We revalidated that the <code>source</code> and <code>target</code> fields in the edge list actually point to existing node IDs. Invalid references were counted to confirm zero mismatches:</p>

<p>From October 1 to October 15, our goal is to investigate daily temporal patterns in communication behavior. This will assist Clepper Jessen, the journalist, in identifying whether messages were broadcast deliberately and whether communication patterns change over the two-week window. Specifically, we aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify peak hours of communication each day.</li>
<li>Detect if those patterns shift over time.</li>
<li>Later, zoom into a specific entity to understand their interactions and influence.</li>
</ul>
<p>We began by filtering the knowledge graph to isolate all nodes labeled as Communication events. These nodes represent intercepted radio messages. From these, we extracted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique ID of each message node</li>
<li>The timestamp of communication</li>
<li>Message content</li>
</ul>

<p>From all communication-type nodes, we filtered only those whose IDs matched the list of communication events Clepper Jensen was involved in. This allowed us to retrieve the exact timestamp of each interaction, which was then decomposed into date and hour components for temporal analysis.</p>
<p>To understand how active Clepper was on each day, we plotted the total number of communications per day using a simple line chart.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="task-2-analyzing-interactions-between-entities">Task 2: Analyzing Interactions Between Entities</h3>
<p>To assist Clepper Jessen in uncovering potential information gatekeepers and influential entities in Oceanus, we analyzed the entity-to-entity interaction network. This section focuses on understanding who interacts with whom, how frequently these interactions occur, and whether tightly-knit communities exist.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reveal which entities interact most frequently</li>
<li>Identify clusters or potential community structures</li>
<li>Detect influential nodes based on centrality</li>
<li>Support further investigations into alias usage or illicit coordination</li>
</ul>
<p>We first filtered the edges to retain only those that connect valid nodes, ensuring no dangling links break the graph:</p>

<p>Node color represents the sub-type, while labels show the entity’s name or alias.</p>
<p>To sharpen the analysis and remove noise from the original full-graph, we applied a filtering strategy to retain only the most relevant node types: Person, Communication, Vessel, Suspicious, and Organization These categories are highly indicative of the kinds of actors Clepper is interested in — individuals, vessel operations, and potential illicit activity.</p>

<p>We focused on nodes of type “Person” and ranked them by degree centrality. The top 10 individuals identified are likely to be central figures in the Oceanus communications network.</p>
<p>These names are of high interest to Clepper, as they may be organizing or coordinating key information flows behind the scenes.</p>

<p>To highlight influential entities, we transformed the network into an interactive graph where node size reflects degree centrality and color indicates sub-type. Hovering over a node reveals both degree and betweenness scores.</p>
<p>This view lets us explore who sits at the core of communication and how they’re connected across groups like “Person”, “Vessel”, or “Suspicious”. Nodes such as The Lookout and Boss stand out prominently, suggesting they may coordinate or monitor key flows of information.</p>

I've managed to photograph the classification markings on the equipment - they're labeled 'Project Poseidon: Resource Extraction Phase'. The conservation vessels appear to be conducting legitimate environmental surveys, but they're being restricted from certain areas.","Miranda, Clepper here. 'Project Poseidon: Resource Extraction Phase' is our smoking gun. Conservation vessels conducting legitimate surveys while being restricted confirms our theory. This is resource exploitation disguised as security measures. Continue documenting restricted zones.","Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've identified a pattern - conservation vessels are being systematically blocked from areas where 'Project Poseidon' equipment is deployed. Harbor security personnel are using falsified environmental clearance documents to justify restrictions.","Miranda, Clepper here. Your discovery about falsified documents is crucial evidence. Focus now on identifying which officials are authorizing these restrictions. Look for signature patterns and document all security personnel involved. This could expose the entire operation chain.","Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've noted conservation vessels are documenting the falsified clearance documents. They seem unaware of their fraudulent nature. Should I attempt to anonymously alert them about Project Poseidon's true purpose?","Miranda, Clepper here. No, don't alert conservation vessels yet - we need more evidence first. Their documentation of falsified clearances is valuable. Instead, track which officials are signing off on these restrictions. This creates plausible deniability for higher-ups we need to identify.","Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've observed harbor security personnel receiving directives from someone with 'Oceanus City Council' credentials. They're systematically updating restricted zone parameters after each conservation vessel report. This suggests council-level involvement in the cover-up.","Miranda, Clepper here. Council-level involvement confirms our suspicions. Follow the paper trail between these officials and Project Poseidon. Document meeting times, locations, and any financial transactions. We're getting close to exposing this entire operation.","Mr. Jensen, Miranda here. I've identified a direct connection - the Oceanus City Council member issuing directives is regularly meeting with unmarked vessels at night. They're exchanging what appear to be data drives and financial documents.

<p>This task focuses on examining what happened on the day with unusual activity—specifically for Nadia Conti. The aim is to retrieve her conversations and prepare to infer intent or link networks.</p>
<p>We pull the to and from communication node IDs Nadia is involved with and ensure they are unique. We filter all communication nodes linked to Nadia, and convert the timestamp to date + hour format. We also add a content_length field to analyze volume.</p>

Miesel shipping lanes overlapping with Mako by 40%. Neptune mentioned 'underwater foundation work' - outside our original scope. Need your assessment.","Liam, Nadia here. Need your services urgently. Investigation brewing around Nemo Reef permits. Double your usual fee if you can ensure Harbor Master remains cooperative through next week. Meet at the usual place tomorrow, 10PM.","Nadia, Liam here. Meeting confirmed for tomorrow at 10PM. I've redirected Harbor Master's attention and implemented new patrol schedules that work in our favor. Council suspects nothing about Nemo Reef. Bring payment as discussed.","Nadia, Davis here. I'll be at the marina office at 7PM with all shipping manifests. Could you bring copies of permit #CR-7844? Marlin's asking about unusual vessel routes near eastern shoals - might need to address this.","Davis, Marlin here again.

Conservation vessels increasing surveillance - could complicate our operation. Bring alternate financial channels in case we need quick adaptation.","Nadia, Liam here. EcoVigil is questioning the ROV delay. I've redirected them to the northern quadrant, but they're suspicious about the southwest. We need to clean up operations there immediately. What's our contingency plan?","Liam, Nadia here. Redirect all remaining operations from southwest immediately. Move equipment to our secondary location. I'll handle EcoVigil through proper channels.
